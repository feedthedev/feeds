# Feed The Dev Feeds

This is the project that contains the feeds used by [Feed The Dev](https://www.feedthedev.com) to show news.

If you would like to add a new source, feel free to fork the repository, add your suggestion to the `feeds.json` file at the root of the project, then submit a pull request.

Please note that these four fields are required for a feed source:

- `title` - This is the title of the source website.
- `website` - This is the link to the source website.
- `feedUrl` - This must be a valid RSS or Atom link.
- `tags` - An array of strings that best describe the website's content. These will be shown with every article from the feed.

If you have any questions, feel free to [contact me](https://www.feedthedev.com/contact/).
